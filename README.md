# React Jobly

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a front-end for a mock jobs website, full of fake companies and jobs.

It is deployed on Surge here: https://moon-jobly.surge.sh/. If you do not want to create an account, you can try this demo account:

- username: test-user
- password: test-user

The code for the Express API back-end is here: https://github.com/lauramoon/express-jobly.

You may clone this repo and explore it for yourself, but it will not do anything interesting unless connected with an appropriate backend, such as the one linked above.
